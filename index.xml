      <description>You can use Rekognition Custom Labels to train your own machine learning models that perform image classification (image level predictions) or object detection (object/bounding box level predictions).
Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels automatically selects the right machine learning algorithm to train your custom machine learning model based on the labeled data you provide without requiring deep learning expertise.
R users can access and use Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels using the fabulous paws package, an AWS SDK for R, created by David Kretch and Adam Banker.</description>

      <description>The SageMaker Fundamentals for R users article series is for experienced R users with no prior Amazon SageMaker knowledge, who want to use their own (local) RStudio installation as an alternative to SageMaker Notebooks to connect to SageMaker to train, tune, evaluate, deploy and monitor machine learning models in the cloud.
In the last article 03 - Hyperparameter tuning we learned how to configure and start a hyperparameter tuning job using the built-in XGBoost algorithm.</description>

      <description>In this article we will demonstrate how to access Amazon Rekognition using the fabulous paws package, an AWS SDK for R, created by David Kretch and Adam Banker.
Amazon Rekognition is a service for image and video analysis which comes with pre-trained deep learning models and a simple API which makes it easy for developers to add these analytics capabilities to their applications.
Some of Amazon Rekognition&amp;rsquo;s features include:
 Object and scene detection Image moderation (checks if the image content is appropriate) Facial analysis Celebrity recognition Face comparison (looking for a facial match in an image based on a single training photo) Text in image (e.</description>
